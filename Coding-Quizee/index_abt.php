     <p class="abt_txt">Coding Quizee offers a wide variety of programming quizzes meant for knowledge that can serve as a kind of a learning aid. Repetition is an important element of learning, and one way to repeat content is through quizzes. Quizzes in learning can be used to motivate learners, help them remember what they learned, and assess what they learned. Evidence from research shows us this and can be used to our advantage, if we follow a few simple principles mentioned above to make our quizzes more effective. So, if you are new to programming, then this a right place to begin with. Quizzes will be updated timely, as you go along you become more experienced, more proficient and more self-confident, and the best thing is that you get all that FOR FREE :-)! All that you have to invest is your time!</p>
